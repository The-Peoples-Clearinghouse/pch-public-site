    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-2">Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="mb-5"><strong>Last updated:</strong> October 8, 2025</p>
    <p class="mb-5">
      <strong>robval</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") operates this mobile application
      (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when
      you use the App.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">
      We do not collect, store, or share personal information from your device
      beyond what is strictly necessary to provide core banking-like features.
      Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul class="mb-5">
      <li>
        <strong>No device information:</strong> We do not collect device identifiers,
        precise location, or other device metadata.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Camera (QR codes):</strong> The App uses the camera solely to scan
        QR codes for payments and related features. Camera input is processed locally
        and is not uploaded to our servers.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contacts (send money faster):</strong> With your permission, the
        App can read your contacts locally to help you find recipients and send money
        faster. Contact data is processed on your device and is <em>not</em> transmitted
        to our servers.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">
      Any information you provide (for example, login credentials or transaction
      details) is used only to deliver the App’s functionality, including
      authentication, initiating transactions, and customer support.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">3. Data Security</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">
      All communication between the App and our servers is encrypted using
      industry-standard protocols (e.g., HTTPS/TLS) to help protect your
      information in transit.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">4. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">
      We do not sell your data. We do not share information with third parties
      for marketing, analytics, or advertising. Service providers (if any)
      engaged to operate or support core App functions are bound by
      confidentiality and security obligations.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">5. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">
      We do not store your contacts or camera content on our servers.
      Transactional and account-related information may be retained as required
      to provide services, comply with law, or resolve disputes.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">6. Your Choices & Permissions</h2>
    <ul class="mb-5">
      <li>
        <strong>Camera permission:</strong> You can disable camera access in your
        device settings; QR scanning features will not work without it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Contacts permission:</strong> You can disable contacts access in
        your device settings; quick-send features may be limited without it.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-xl mb-2">7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p class="mb-5">
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post any
      changes within the App and update the “Last updated” date above.
    </p>
